                Canyoning in Nevidio is a mix of skating, swimming, climbing, jumping from a waterfall, jumping off cliffs and high banks into deep pools.
                You can jump all of them or use the alternative routes, but you shall pass!
                Nevidio Canyon is ranked as the easiest canyon to walk through and is recommended as an adventure activity for anyone who wants to experience the beautiful nature of Durmitor National Park.

                Canyoning in Nevidio is a mix of skating, swimming, climbing, jumping from a waterfall, jumping off cliffs and high banks into deep pools.
                 There are about 10 jumps for the bravest adventurers, but most can be avoided by alternative routes.
                 The lower limit is about 8 years, depending on the constitution of the child. The upper limit does not essentially exist, as long as someone feels capable of passing through.

                <h2>6 Hours Of Amazing Adventure</h2>
                <p>
                It takes about 3 hours to get through Nevidio Canyon on average. When the canyoning is complete, it takes you an hour to walk to the starting point (about 45 minutes uphill).
                Individual passing is not recommended because it could be extremely dangerous for people who do not know the canyon. In these cases, tour ends with rescue service coming to help people go out from the canyon.
