                <h2>
                    SAFETY</h2>
                <p>
                Safety is always our main concern, and our tandem flight instructors have years of experience, and we use only the latest and safest paragliding equipment.
                Pilots make decisions based on their safety as well as yours. 
                Paragliding is not risk-free, and you must sign a liability waiver acknowledging that you are aware that paragliding does have risks.
                </p>

                <h2>LENGTH</h2>
                <p>
                The whole experience is about one hour. The actual flight time depends on the weather conditions that day.
                Flights generally last between 15 and 20 minutes.
                Tandem paragliders allow a weight range for passengers to be anywhere from 15 kg to 125 kg.
                </p>
                <h2>CLOTHES</h2>
                <p>
                During the tandem flight, it is preferable to have pants and long sleeves.
                Also, on many occasions, we recommend you bring a thin jacket or a windstopper.
                A bottle of water, sunscreen lotion, and a camera if you wish to take your photos. 
                Note that any camera you bring with you has to be secured by a strap.
